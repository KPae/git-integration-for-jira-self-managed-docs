The Add new integration panel (_formerly Auto-Connect integration panel_) contains special integration for specific git hosts, supports multiple connected repositories and automates git integration.

We highly recommend this feature for multiple repository configuration. This setup offers features not found on single repository connections such as creating branches/pull/merge requests from Jira.

Access the Add new integration panel on the Git Integration app configuration page (_from your Jira dashboard menu Git ➜ Manage repositories_).

For more details on this topic, see the connection information for your favorite git host in our [Integration Guides](/git-integration-for-jira-data-center/integration-guides-gij-self-managed).
