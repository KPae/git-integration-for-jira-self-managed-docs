<!-- TROUBLESHOOTING -->

### Problem

There will be some performance issues when the following conditions are met:

*   you are using GIJ 4.19 or earlier

*   you have enabled “Enforced git permissions” in General settings

*   with each reindex of some of your integration, GIJ also tries to detect new nested repositories, which for some reason, can't be cloned. The root cause could be one or some of the following:

    *   Corrupt pack file errors

    *   Max object size error

    *   Git -upload pack errors for multiple repositories

    *   Timeout errors

    *   401 error with a different user

    *   Error getting repository permissions for user XXXXXXXX – 401 unauthorized error

### Diagnosis

With each reindex of the integration, permissions for all the users PATs are recalculated. It’s a heavy calculation degrading performance, high CPU usage and increasing a possibility of exceeding GitService rate limit.

### Solution

Upgrade to GIJ 4.20 or later.

If you can’t upgrade due to production workflow policies for now, then setup a JMESPath filter for the integration to exclude the affected nested repositories.
