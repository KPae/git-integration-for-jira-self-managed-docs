**NOTE:** This setting replaces the Smart commit max age setting.

The scripting feature now uses the global setting instead of hardcoded value (1 week).

<img src='/wp-content/uploads/gij-gitserverdc-git-data-proc-age-limit.png' style='display:block;max-width:100%;margin:30px auto' />

Set the value according to your organizationâ€™s requirements. The default value for this setting is **14 days**.

The commits or pull/merge requests are processed by Git Integration for Jira app if they are within the maximum age value (in days). Otherwise, they are skipped from processing.

_The commits are also compared against `on-commit.js` script file creation timestamp and if they are found to be older than the age limit value, they are skipped from processing._

_The pull/merge requests are also compared against `on-merge-req-ZZZ.js` script file creation timestamp and if they are found to be older than the age limit value, they are skipped from processing._
