The following instructions are for migrations of Jira to a different server. See [Upgrades and migrations within same server](/git-integration-for-jira-data-center/upgrades-and-migrations-within-same-server-gij-self-managed) instructions for in-place upgrades or migrations.

        We strongly recommend performing your migration in a test environment first. Do not migrate your production Jira server application until you are satisfied that your test environment upgrade is successful.

### Before you migrate

We recommend Jira admins to upgrade to the latest version of [Git Integration app from the Atlassian Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/4984/git-integration-for-jira?hosting=server&tab=versions).

Run the instance for some time (a few days or weeks) and once the testing is stable â€“ then do the migration.

### Upgrade/migrate

Follow the [standard instructions from Atlassian on migrating to another server](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver073/migrating-jira-applications-to-another-server-861253107.html) (select your Jira version).

No extra steps are required.

### After you migrate

Verify that configured integrations and repositories in the **Manage Git repositories** screen are correct and index properly.
