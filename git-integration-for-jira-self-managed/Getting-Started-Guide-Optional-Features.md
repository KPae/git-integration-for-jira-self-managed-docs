Congratulations! You have now successfully completed your base GIJ configuration.! The following features and free add-on extension applications are not necessary for the operation of GIJ, but do provide additional value on top of the base functionality, so we recommend that you explore them.

**Feature: Automation for Jira triggers**
Our application provides triggers to the built in Jira Automation system that can be used to structure automation rules to perform all sorts of actions such as Issue transitions, or adding comments based on certain events that happen in your repositories. Please see [GIJ + Jira Automation](https://help.gitkraken.com/git-integration-for-jira-cloud/git-integration-jira-automation-gij-cloud/) for further details.


## Add-on Extension applications
**CI/CD for Jira**
CI/CD for Jira is used to display build and deployment data in Jira. Please note that CI/CD only supports builds and deployments that are created through the same Git service as your integrations. We do not support builds and deployments created through external services. CI/CD for Jira is available [here](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1228578/ci-cd-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) and you can view further details for the application [here](https://help.gitkraken.com/git-integration-for-jira-cloud/cicd-getting-started-with-ci-cd-for-jira-gij-cloud/)

**Team Insights for Jira**
Team insights for Jira is a free stand alone application that we offer that is geared towards planning and sprint work management. While the application works independently, it can be used alongside with GIJ in order to view development information inside TIJ, providing a clearer view of work progress. Team Insights for Jira is available [here](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1230390/team-insights-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) and you can see further details for the application [here](https://help.gitkraken.com/git-integration-for-jira-cloud/team-insights-for-jira-gij-cloud/)
