Manage connected repositories or integration via the ![](/wp-content/uploads/actions-icon.png) **Actions** commands on the git configuration page.

## Introduction

After successfully connecting your git repositories or integrating your git host via Git Integration for Jira app, you can change repository settings depending on the connection protocol of the repository or integration.

## Getting started

On the git repository configuration page, you can manage connected repositories and integration such as enabling/disabling repository connection/integration (Jira Server only), edit/update repository/integration settings or disconnect repositories/integrations.
