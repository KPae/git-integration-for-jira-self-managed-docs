This feature scans a locally accessible path for cloned Git repositories and automatically imports those Git repository references into Jira. A repository group called <b style='background-color:#DEEAFE; padding:1px 5px; color:#0C42A3; border-radius:3px; margin: 0 5px; font-size: small;'>FOLDER</b> is added into the Git Integration app repository configuration list.
