Self-signed certificates are common in HTTPS Git repositories that are hosted privately. Even for an administrator, it's not easy to set the HTTP `sslVerify` to connect to this repository.

The Jira administrator now has the option to disable `sslVerify` for specific repositories while inside Jira.

This feature is available in [Connect to Git Repository](/git-integration-for-jira-data-center/using-the-connect-repository-wizard-gij-self-managed) wizard and [Add new integration wizard](/git-integration-for-jira-data-center/using-the-add-new-integration-wizard-gij-self-managed) for GitHub and GitLab.

The self-signed HTTPS integration can be configured automatically or manually. See next topic for automatic setup.
