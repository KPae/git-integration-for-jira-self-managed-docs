Jira automation allows teams and groups to control processes and workflows using a rule to automate actions within Jira based on criteria.

The automation rules have 3 parts:

*   **Triggers** - Listens for events and starts the execution of a rule when a set condition is met.

*   **Conditions** - Set the scope of a rule with specific events tailored for your team.

*   **Actions** - Set automated tasks to perform when a condition is met.

&nbsp;

### Permissions

Any user with Browser Project permissions can create a rule.

&nbsp;

### Git Integration for Jira app supported triggers

We currently support the following triggers:

*   Branch created

*   Commit created

*   Pull request created

*   Pull request merged

*   Pull request declined

And thus, we will support all of these triggers in the coming releases. The presence of these triggers extends the automation capabilities of Jira by providing additional conditions.

&nbsp;

### Getting started with Automation for Jira

On Jira Cloud, the Automation for Jira has been completely integrated into Jira Cloud and no longer exists as a standalone app in the Atlassian Marketplace. For Jira Server/Data Center, you will need to download and install Automation for Jira - Data Center and Server from the Atlassian Marketplace.

#### Downloading the app

1.  Go to [Automation for Jira - Data Center and Server](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1215460/automation-for-jira-data-center-and-server?hosting=datacenter&tab=overview) and start the free trial or buy it now.

2.  Login to your Atlassian account when prompted and generate a new license for the trial.

3.  <b style='background-color:#FFF1B6; padding:1px 5px; color:#172A4C; border-radius:3px; margin: 0 5px; font-size: small;'>IMPORTANT!</b> Make sure to copy your license and save it.

4.  Click **Download** to download the app to your local system.

### How to set up automation templates

Create a rule to configure triggers and actions for automating tasks. There are two levels:

#### Project level (projects)

Project rules only apply within specific projects.

![](/wp-content/uploads/gij-gitserverdc-jira-automation-project-level-loc.png)

1.  Open a project to work on, then go to ![](/wp-content/uploads/gij-jira-sys-admin-icon.png) **Project settings**.

2.  On the Project settings sidebar, click **Automation**.

3.  On the Automation screen, click **Project rules.**

    *   <b style='background-color:#FFF1B6; padding:1px 5px; color:#172A4C; border-radius:3px; margin: 0 5px; font-size: small;'>OPTIONAL</b> Click **Add template rules** to add built-in preset automation rules generated by Git Integration for Jira app to the current project.

4.  Click **Create rule** (adjacent to **...**) to manually create a new automation rule for the current project. Skip the tour, if prompted, then proceed to start creating the new rule.

5.  Configure triggers, conditions and actions for this rule.

    ![](/wp-content/uploads/gij-gitserverdc-create-automation-rule-example-422.png)

6.  For the above example:

    *   **TRIGGER** – This rule will trigger when a pull request is created.

    *   **CONDITION** – When the status of the Jira issue is IN PROGRESS, it will perform the actions below.

    *   **ACTIONS** – If the condition(s) are met, the rule will fire up the action(s) -- assigns the issue to a specific group REVIEWERS and transitions the Jira issue to <b style='background-color:#FFF1B6; padding:1px 5px; color:#172A4C; border-radius:3px; margin: 0 5px; font-size: small;'>IN REVIEW</b>.

7.  Enter a descriptive name for this rule in the provided box.

8.  Click **Turn it on** to publish and activate it. The new rule is added to the automation list.

&nbsp;

#### Global administration level (system)

Global rules apply to all projects. If there are similar automation rule triggers from one or more projects, the global rule is executed first.

The steps for creating automation rules for global level is exactly the same as the Project level instructions.

1.  Access the global automation rules via ![](/wp-content/uploads/actions-icon.png) Jira settings ➜ **System**.

    ![](/wp-content/uploads/gij-gitserverdc-system-menu-sidebar-automation-sel.png)

2.  On the sidebar under Automation for Jira, click **Automation rules**.

3.  Click **Create rules**.

4.  Configure triggers, conditions and actions for this rule.

    ![](/wp-content/uploads/gij-gitserverdc-create-automation-rule-example-global-422.png)

    *   **TRIGGER** – This rule will trigger when a commit is created.

    *   **CONDITION** – When the ASSIGNEE is the commit author, it will perform the action(s) below.

    *   **ACTIONS** – If the condition(s) are met, the rule will fire up the actions – assign the issue to a specific group TESTERS and transitions the Jira issue to IN TESTING.

5.  Enter a descriptive name for this rule in the provided box.

6.  Click **Turn it on** to publish and activate it. The new rule is added to the automation list.
