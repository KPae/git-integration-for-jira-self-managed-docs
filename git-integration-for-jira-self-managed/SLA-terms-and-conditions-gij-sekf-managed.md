### Customer Responsibilities

**Git Integration for Jira as a Self-Managed App**<br>
GitKraken’s support policy is consistent with [Atlassian’s End of life policy (EOL)](https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-support-end-of-life-policy-201851003.html), for self-managed Jira (Server and Data Center). Atlassian supports feature versions for two years after release. GitKraken products for self-managed Jira are supported for at least two years. Additionally – we support older versions of Jira when it is technically possible. See official version compatibility at the [Atlassian Marketplace: Versions](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/4984/git-integration-for-jira/version-history) page.

**Git Integration for Jira as a Cloud App**<br>
GitKraken’s support policy is consistent with [Atlassian’s End of life policy (EOL)](https://confluence.atlassian.com/support/atlassian-support-end-of-life-policy-201851003.html), for Jira Cloud. We follow Atlassian’s guidelines for deprecated features and support cycles. For either platform, make sure that your JRE is on the current version so that it is in line with security updates and features.

### GIt Integration for Jira Support

*   Support requests for Git Integration for Jira Data Center app are to be submitted at [Contact Support](https://help.gitkraken.com/git-integration-for-jira-data-center/gij-self-hosted-contact-support/). Interactions with users submitting tickets are done primarily through emails, though other communication services such as phone calls, screenshare services might be used to deliver Support Services.

    *   We still offer limited support to Jira Server clients. For more information, see **For Self-hosted clients** bulleted item below.

*   Support Hours are 7:00am to 4:00pm Monday to Friday, ArizonaTime (UTC-7) with a response time of 1 (one) business day. While support requests can be submitted by users at any time, responses to requests and interactions with support are provided during Support Hours only.

*   If you are a subscriber to Git Integration for Jira Data Center app, you are entitled for a guaranteed support. This includes any of our bundle products such as CI/CD for Jira and Team Insights for Jira.

*   Git Integration for Jira Data Center app is available on platforms that Jira supports. See the current supported versions on our [Atlassian Marketplace Versions](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/4984/git-integration-for-jira/version-history) page.

*   Best effort support is provided for Students and Education users, we aim to respond quickly and help as much as possible, but we do not have any guaranteed response window.

*   While we try to accommodate everyone who reaches out, a response is not guaranteed to all users. This includes any users who are free users, students and academics, and a couple of scenarios below:

    *   For Self-hosted clients, we will provide some additional support -- since the license is technically indefinite for a long time and the application will continue to be working. Until the Server is completely gone, support would still apply and we will try to assist Server users regardless of their license status.

    *   For Cloud clients, we will also provide support where:

        *  the app doesn’t function due to license being expired; and

        *  app installation needing to be manually re-enabled once the license is renewed.

### Support Period

We will support Generally Available (GA) releases of products. Eligible code fixes and hot fixes are provided via a new release (Z) on top of the latest “Major release” and “minor release” branch. A major release is identified by a change in the first (X), minor release is identified by the second (Y) digit in the following versioning nomenclature: Version X.Y.Z.

As a best practice, we expect customers to stay at the current release in order to receive optimal support. Release updates for customers are provided regularly on the [Atlassian Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/4984/git-integration-for-jira-github-gitlab-and-more?tab=overview&hosting=datacenter) for each GitKraken product related to Git Integration for Jira:

*   Git Integration for Jira Cloud
*   Git Integration for Jira Data Center
*   Dev Info for Jira
*   CI/CD for Jira
*   Team Insights for Jira

While we will provide troubleshooting assistance to GA products, we might ask customers to upgrade to the current release during the troubleshooting process in order for them to receive functionality enhancements, security updates, and code fixes.

### End-of-Life

GitKraken will support a Major release for a period of at least 12 (twelve) months from the major release, excluding minor and patch releases (eg version 4.Y.Z will be eligible for support for 12 month period from when the 4.0.x version was released). However, while troubleshooting customer issues, a customer may be asked to upgrade to the current release.

GitKraken’s end-of-life policy provides that GitKraken will provide customers with at least sixty (60) days’ prior notice before discontinuing any product. After the End of Life Period expires, GitKraken will no longer be obligated to provide support services for the deprecated software.

### End of Life (EoL) process

The decision to retire or deprecate features follows a rigorous process, including understanding the demand, use, impact of feature retirement, and, most importantly, customer feedback. Our goal is to invest resources in areas that will add the most value for the most customers. GitKraken is committed to being clear, transparent, and proactive when interacting with our customers, especially about changes to our products.

To that end, we will do our best to follow these guidelines when retiring functionality:

-   **Advance notice:** For the EoL of major features or products, we will attempt to notify customers at least 60 (sixty) days in advance.

-   **Viable alternatives:** GitKraken will strive to provide viable alternatives to our customers when retiring functionality. These may be alternative offerings from GitKraken or recommended alternatives from 3rd party providers. Where possible and appropriate, GitKraken is willing to provide migration support assistance to customers to alternatives for retired functionality.

-   **Continued support:** GitKraken commits to providing continued support for functionality until its retirement date.

We may need to accelerate the timeline for EoL of functionality in extenuating circumstances, such as essential changes necessary to protect the integrity of our platform or the security of our customers and others. In these cases, we put the highest priority to bring those changes to commence as immediate as possible. For more information, see [Security and Trust](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-integration-for-jira/security-and-trust).

Similarly, integrated third-party software or services may need to be retired due to the third-party decision to change or retire their solution. In these situations, the pace of retirement will be beyond our control.

However, even under these circumstances, we will provide as much advance notice as possible.
