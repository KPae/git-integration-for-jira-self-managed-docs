Congratulations! You have now successfully completed your base GIJ configuration.! The following features and free add-on extension applications are not necessary for the operation of GIJ, but do provide additional value on top of the base functionality, so we recommend that you explore them.

### Feature: Automation for Jira triggers

Our application provides triggers to the built in Jira Automation system that can be used to structure automation rules to perform all sorts of actions such as Issue transitions, or adding comments based on certain events that happen in your repositories. Please see [GIJ + Jira Automation](https://help.gitkraken.com/git-integration-for-jira-data-center/git-integration-plus-jira-automation-gij-self-managed/) for further details.

### Extension - Team Insights for Jira
Team insights for Jira is a free stand alone application that we offer that is geared towards planning and sprint work management. While the application works independently, it can be used alongside with GIJ in order to view development information inside TIJ, providing a clearer view of work progress. Please see the [Team Insights for Jira marketplace listing](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1230390/team-insights-for-jira?hosting=datacenter&tab=overview) to install the application.
