## Does it take long to install?

No. With Atlassian Marketplace, you can install the Git Integration for Jira app from inside of your JIRA server using your browser. You don't have to go to the server command line to copy files or configure XML files.

## I don't know Git — what will I need to install the app/add-on?

For the most common setups, you will need the URL to your Git server and credentials to access it. Tell your Git administrator that you need access to the Git repository just like a regular developer would have. They will provide what you need.

## What will my JIRA look like after it is installed?

A new tab is added in each issue. A new tab is added in each project.

## How do I install the plugin in a development version of JIRA?

Atlassian has posted the following relevant information regarding Atlassian Marketplace apps/add-ons and development licenses of JIRA: [https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace#licensingandpricing-4](https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace#licensingandpricing-4)

Which points to:

[Licensing and Paid via Atlassian Listings](https://developer.atlassian.com/market/add-on-licensing-for-developers/licensing-and-paid-via-atlassian-listings)

Go to the section titled, **"Can customers use developer licenses for my add-on?"**, which has instructions on how to get a developer license for apps/add-ons.

        A developer license can be generated (free of charge) once the plugin has been purchased and can only be installed on a development licensed version of JIRA.
